This is an example of a robotic application which must be device-agnostic. It imports the RappRobot module which must be included in the ```PYTHONPATH``` (Check [here](https://github.com/rapp-project/rapp-robots-api/tree/python_api/python) and just invokes the device agnostic API calls. If the specific device has not implemented a specific call, an error is returned.
